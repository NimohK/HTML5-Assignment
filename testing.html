    <p>I start my day by checking emails and replying to messages. Then, I schedule meetings and update calendars for my clients. I also do research, create reports, and manage social media posts. Sometimes, I book travel or handle customer support tasks. I make sure everything is organized so my clients can focus on their work. At the end of the day, I review tasks and plan for tomorrow.</p>
